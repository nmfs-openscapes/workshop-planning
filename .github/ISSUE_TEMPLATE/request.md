Use this issue to reserve access to the NMFS Workshop Hub URL: https://workshop.nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud

See current reserved times here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4qzqWLsKHTNzuQi-fOaHGud0Ld_q1GHAzhS9-grV7Q/edit?usp=sharing> (look at NMFS tab). 
*I cannot see the spreadsheet.* Reach out to Eli so we can add you to the Openscapes group that has view access.

**Describe the event**
Short description is fine

**Event Start Date/Time	and Event End Date/Time**

**Reset Date**
If you want the participants to have more or less access than the default of 7 days.

**Number of Participants**
Roughly.

**Resources that Participant Need**

1. What RAM will participants typically need? 2Gb (default), 4Gb, more? This is selected in the dropdown and knowing what you will need, helps us make sure the hub is adequately provisioned.
2. Are there any special storage needs? Like will participants need access to large shared files? Do you anticipate that participants might download lots (10s of Gb or more) of data? If so, we will work with you on how best to do that in the workshop. We have a S3 scratch bucket and a shared drive so that we don't have 10s of copies of big data sets.

**Once we confirm**

You will see your event in the [workshop spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4qzqWLsKHTNzuQi-fOaHGud0Ld_q1GHAzhS9-grV7Q/edit?usp=sharing). 
Your event password will be live on the "Password Change Date" in column 1 in the spreadsheet.

**Checkboxes for organizer and hub POC**

- [ ] **Hub POC**: Sent confirmation to organizer
- [ ] **Organizer**: I have given a password to hub POC
- [ ] **Hub POC**: Submitted a ticket to 2i2c for the workshop.
- [ ] **Organizer**: Two weeks before event. I have tested the default hub images on the nmfs-openscapes.2i2c.cloud hub or conferred with hub POC on plan for workshop specific hub.
- [ ] **Organizer**: In the week before the event (or when POC indicates password should be live). I tested that the workshop password works and images work.
- [ ] **Hub POC**: After event, put in a 2i2c ticket to remove the participants directories, cleared shared-public, and reset password.
