*I cannot see the spreadsheet.* Reach out to Eli so we can add you to the Openscapes group that has edit access.

**Describe the event**
Short description is fine

**Event Start Date	and Event End Date***

**Reset Date**
If you want the participants to have more or less access than the default of 7 days.

**Once we confirm**

You will see your event in the [workshop spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4qzqWLsKHTNzuQi-fOaHGud0Ld_q1GHAzhS9-grV7Q/edit?usp=sharing). 
Your event password will be live on the "Password Change Date" in column 1 in the spreadsheet.
